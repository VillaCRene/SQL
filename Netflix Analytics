-- In this project I was provided a repo on bit.io and asked to answer questions. This is an example of using the PostgreSQL dialect.

	1. How many movie titles are there in the database? (movies only, not tv shows)
		SELECT count(*)
		FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" AS t
		WHERE t.type = 'Movie';
		
			6131
			
	2. When was the most recent batch of tv shows and/or movies added to the database?
		SELECT max(t.date_added)
		FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" AS t;
		
			2021-09-25 00:00:00
			
	3. List all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order.
		SELECT t.title
		FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" AS t
		WHERE t.type = 'Movie' OR t.type = 'TV Show'
		ORDER BY t.title;
		
			
		
	4. Who was the Director for the movie Bright Star?
		SELECT p.director
		FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" AS t
		JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" AS p
		ON t.show_id = p.show_id
		WHERE t.title = 'Bright Star';
		
			Jane Campion
		
	5. What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made?
		Answer key suggests:
			SELECT t.title, t.release_year
			FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" AS t
			WHERE t.type = 'Movie'
			ORDER BY t.release_year asc
			LIMIT 1
			
		It really should this because two movies share the oldest year:
			SELECT title, release_year 
			FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
			WHERE type = 'Movie'
			AND release_year <= 
			(SELECT MIN(release_year) 
			FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type = 'Movie');
